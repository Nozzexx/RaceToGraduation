# üéì RaceToGraduation
*Computer Graphics Project - UTD Spring 2024*

**RaceToGraduation** is a procedurally generated maze horror game developed using Unity in C# for a university project. In this game, players are trapped in a nightmare version of the University of Texas at Dallas campus, and their only goal is to escape the labyrinth while being relentlessly pursued by a terrifying version of the school's mascot, **TEMOC**.

## üïπÔ∏è **Game Concept**

In **RaceToGraduation**, you, the player, find yourself lost in a maze inspired by the chaotic college life experience. But it‚Äôs not just the labyrinth you need to fear. TEMOC, the university mascot, has taken on a sinister form and is hunting you through the procedurally generated maze. The longer you play, the more challenging the maze becomes, and TEMOC gets more aggressive, making escape even harder. Can you survive the horror and make it to graduation?
